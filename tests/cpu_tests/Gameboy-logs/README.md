# Gameboy-logs
Emulation logs of common beginner ROMs for the Gameboy.
Currently contains a log of the boot ROM (DMG) as well as all of Blargg's ROMs

All these logs were generated with my own emulator which passes Blargg's CPU tests.

For the convenience of anyone who uses them, LY (MMIO register at 0xFF44) is stubbed to 0x90 permanently.

If you have any suggestions contact me on Discord: guccirodakino#1457

Or on Nintendo Switch Online: SW-8356-6970-6111

Note: All logs are zipped. The Blargg10 and Blargg11 one had to be zipped **twice** cause they're too :beeg:

Format: [registers] (mem[pc] mem[pc+1] mem[pc+2] mem[pc+3])
  
I log the state of the CPU BEFORE every instruction
